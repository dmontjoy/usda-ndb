This is a version of the frontend that runs on Google AppEngine, rather than
a standalone web server.

Rather than uploading the large ASCII text databases, this server uses a
GOB-encoded, GZip-compressed version of the database produced by the dbio/dbio
program.

To run this server on AppEngine, do the following (from the usda-ndb directory):

  $ go run dbio/dbio.go -asciidb=data -output=appengine/asciidb.gob.gz
  $ /path/to/go_appengine/appcfg.py --oauth2 update appengine/
